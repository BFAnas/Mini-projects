# About this repo:
During my master's degree in modeling for science and engineering at Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, I had the chance to work on multiple mini projects in SQL, Spark, C, R and Python. this repository is to display those works for anyone interested, i hope you'll find them informative and if you have any question question or recommendation I'll be more than happy to recieve them.
