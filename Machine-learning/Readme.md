#Machine learning project: using decision trees, random forests and xgboost for the prediction of energy cosumption for buildings
Here we worked on an interesting problem wich is currently open as a competition on ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III - kaggle. In this problem we are given the data for the hourly energy consumption of 1450 buildings for the year 2016, and the goal is to find the best model that could infer what the hourly energy consumption for this buildings would be like for the years 2017 and 2018. This model would be used to predict the conterfactual energy consumption of these buildings, have they not been rehabilitated to improve their energy efficiency, and to estimate the gains made and the impact of similar investements in the futur. We did a very detailed data exploration and preparation process and tried with decision trees, random forest and xgboost as ML models.
